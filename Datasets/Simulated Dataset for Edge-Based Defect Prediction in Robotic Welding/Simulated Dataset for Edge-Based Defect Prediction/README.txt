Simulated Robotic Welding Dataset

Description:
This dataset includes 300 simulated samples of robotic welding process parameters.
Each row represents one weld operation.

Columns:
- Arc Voltage (V)
- Weld Current (A)
- Weld Speed (cm/min)
- Wire Feed Speed (m/min)
- Gas Flow Rate (L/min)
- Torch Angle (°)
- Base Metal Temp (°C)
- Defect (0 = no defect, 1 = defect)

Usage:
Designed for machine learning model training, edge computing deployment, and welding defect prediction research.
